# 🤖 GPT-4 Language Model Application

This application showcases the use of GPT-4, the large language model developed by OpenAI, to generate content based on user prompts. 

## 🎯 Features

- **Chat**(Will WORK without OpenAI and Internet Connection): Chat with the local GPT-4 if you do not have an openAI api. Input a prompt and receive a response generated by the model.

- **Wizard**(Will generate without OpenAI, but needs Internet): A content generator that uses the model to generate creative titles and scripts.

- **Read Finance**(need OpenAI, not stable to use local LLMs): A feature that uses the model to analyze financial reports. You can upload a PDF of a report, and the model will analyze it and generate a summary.

- **Code**(need OpenAI, not stable to use local LLMs): Generate and fix code snippets. Input a description of a function or a faulty code snippet, and the model will generate a correct version. (Now support: **Python**, **Java**, **C**, **C++**, **Ruby**, **Scala**, **C#**, **Swift**, **JavaScript**, **GO**, **Kotlin**, **Objective C** )
